## Description

What is language? What are symbols? What is the meaning of meaning? If language shapes thought, to what
extent does it limit our ability to perceive reality? And in a reality of misinformation, infinite viewpoints and computers
being capable of rendering imposing high fidelity graphics anywhere, do our simple abstracted symbols even
matter? Aren't we ultimately held back by the minimalist character of our 2D alphabetic characters? "m-SRT-s
Revision III" allows the exploration of a virtual space trying to answer these questions. Moving through the space
from point to point reveals various viewpoints from science, philosophy, fiction and art. Shifting from meaning to
intuition. From reading to observing. From the known to the unknown. 

The main focus is a complex morphing 3D shape serving as a placeholder for the
aforementioned philosophical ideas and questions and reflecting the fluid hyper-dimensional properties of meaning
that's mainly explored by modern machine learning applications. This generative symbol, placed in a virtual
environment, connects both the known space of reality that we navigate daily and the unknown array of (in)finite
possibilities that we are yet to understand. Various texts, quotes, thoughts and questions serve as hints and
suggestions about the context of this project. The texts were manually sourced from a broad range of scientific and
literary sources including neuroscience, linguistics, humanities, philosophy, etc. Accompanying these visual
elements is a fully live-synthesized soundscape made by Philipp von Neumann, reacting to the shifting parameters
of the visualization, pulling viewers into a flow of sound and visuals, heightening focus and immersion. This
interdisciplinary project was realized using VVVV and Csound.
