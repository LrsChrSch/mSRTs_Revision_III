This folder contains the publicly available data.

These just get hosted next to the main files when hosting. 

So this readme.md will be available under "/readme.md".
The preview image for the first sculpture would be under "/data/0Preview.webp"

This is also where samples might go "/samples/sample.mp3" or something like that.
